VERSIONING
Version numbers will follow semantic versioning: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

STYLE
Functions:
1)Class Methods should be lowercase and use underscores to separate words (as will non-constant variables)
ex. example_function

The reason for this is that these functions are (visibly) implemented as table values.

2)Otherwise, functions will be camel-cased ex. ExampleFunction

Variables:
1) All non-constant variables are lower case and if names are compound, component words are separated by underscores ex: example_variable

2)All constant values are all CAPS with underscores ex. EXAMPLE_CONSTANT

3)Booleans should be preceded by a word that implies its type ex's: is_, will_,...

Arbitrary Comments on General Good Practice:
Try to avoid creating local values in scope of a loop. Rather than reallocating memory for new values and potentially bogging down the garbage collector,
just set the variable to nil outside the loop's scope and reassign it within scope.

In this way, setting the garbage collector to be more aggressive doesn't make it keep having to free up space we are just going to reallocate
